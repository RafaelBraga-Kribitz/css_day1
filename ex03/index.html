        <div class="article-body">
            <p style="color: rgb(139, 138, 138);">A Florida man is making headlines once again after he allegedly stole a live alligator from a local park and decided to take it on a joyride through his town's McDonald's drive-thru. Witnesses report the man calmly ordered a large coffee and fries before tossing the 3-foot-long gator into the window of the restaurant.</p>
            <p>"He just looked so casual about it," said one customer who was waiting behind the man. "Like this was just another Tuesday for him. Who even thinks of doing that?"</p>

            <p>Local authorities were alerted, and the man was apprehended shortly after. The alligator, thankfully, was unharmed and returned to the wild, though it was "pretty rattled" by the experience according to wildlife officers. As for the man, when questioned by police, he simply shrugged and said, "It seemed like a good idea at the time."</p>

            <p>Florida, a state already known for its bizarre and outlandish headlines, continues to keep the internet buzzing with its wild "Florida Man" stories. The suspect now faces multiple charges, including theft of an alligator and assault with a dangerous reptile.</p>
