[] Create an HTML document resembling a simple newspaper article, with a
headline, a list of authors, a short topical summary on top and then some
regular text.

[] Now, together with your partner, plan on applying CSS rules through
inline-styles, the '<style>' tag and an external CSS document
simultaneously.

[] Define the effects that you want to achieve and spread them out over these
three sources. Now prepare some fallback styles, for example a different
font-family or color, in another source or with less specificity, in a way that
you think will not be affecting your document.
