[] Take the HTML document of your previous exercise and have all its
elements displayed again.

[] Add two short forms with two inputs of the type “text” each. One form
should be the last child of the container. The other form should not be a
container's child, and it should have a button.

[] Bring back the <p> element in the div with class='right' that you
previously hid.

[] Then give the <p> element in the <div id='third'> a background-color of
your choice but make sure the p-element in the <div id='fifth'> doesn't get
changed.
